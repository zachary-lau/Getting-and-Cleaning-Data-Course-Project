# Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project
## Project Description
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. You will be graded by your peers on a series of yes/no questions related to the project. You will be required to submit: 1) a tidy data set as described below, 2) a link to a Github repository with your script for performing the analysis, and 3) a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md. You should also include a README.md in the repo with your scripts. This repo explains how all of the scripts work and how they are connected.

## Files included in this repository:
* README.md - This README file for the repository
* CodeBook.md - A description of the data, variables, and transformations included
* run_analysis.R - The script use to generate the tidy dataset
* tidy_data.txt - The tidy dataset output of the included R script

Using the run_analysis.R script:
Simply download and run the source("run_analysis.R"). The script will proceed to download the original dataset. The final output of the script will be stored in the tidy_data.txt file.
